                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        YNABcompanion is an app that allows you to add transactions or transfers on your phone and later transfer them to YNAB on your computer.
                        It's not a fully-featured YNAB app (that's in development as a separate app), but it's a great way to quickly keep track of transactions.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Level2}">Transaction management</TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        It's easy to add a transaction in YNAB.
                        Pressing the "plus" symbol in the menu opens up a screen to create a new transaction, and filling it in is straightforward.
                        If you enter in account, category, or subcategory info into a textbox, that data will appear in a list the next time you add a transaction.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Break}"/>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        Long-pressing a transaction from the "Transactions" page allows the user to edit the transaction or delete it.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Break}"/>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        YNABcompanion also has supports for transfers between accounts.
                        Pressing the "transfer" symbol in the menu opens up a screen to create a new transfer, and it's even faster to create a transfer than a transaction!
                        It's important to note that transfers appear as two transactions in the "Transactions" page: one for the outflow, and another for the inflow.
                        For example, if I create a transfer of $50 from A to B, there will be a transaction on A for an outflow of $50, and another transaction on B for an inflow of $50.
                        Editing or deleting one of these transactions will perform the same operation on the other.
                        And of course, if these transactions/transfers are exported to Dropbox, YNAB will understand them correctly.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Level2}">Syncing YNABcompanion and YNAB</TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        Because YNABcompanion is not a fully-featured YNAB mobile app, it cannot sync transactions automagically with YNAB.
                        However, syncing transactions between the two apps is still very easy and is done with Dropbox.
                        In fact, the power of YNABcompanion lies in ability to import and export data to and from Dropbox.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Break}"/>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        To sync transactions, it's recommended to import your YNAB budget and register to get access to your account names and budget info.
                        This only needs to be done once, and ensures that YNAB can read YNABcompanion's transactions correctly.
                        After that, users can export their transactions from YNABcompanion to Dropbox, which can then be imported into YNAB.
                        See the sections below for more info.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Level2}">Importing data from Dropbox</TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        If you export your budget and your transaction history to Dropbox, and import the exported files into YNABcompanion, this app will learn your budget's accounts, categories, and subcategories.
                        This enables YNABcompanion to export proper transaction files for YNAB, so it is highly recommended to do this.
                        You will only need to do this once to enjoy the benefits, although it's recommended that you perform this process whenever you change account information or the budget's categories.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Break}"/>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        Ideally, this step should be done before you do anything else.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Break}"/>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        Alternatively, you manually enter in account info and budget info, but a typo can cause errors when importing transactions into YNAB.
                        Additionally, you can always manually enter in this info even if you've imported the budget and transactions.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Break}"/>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        To import this data, tap the "Import" button on the menu. 
                        If it's the first time you've imported or exported anything, you will be prompted to sign into Dropbox and allow YNABcompanion access.
                        Once that's done, select the exported budget and register csv files, which are usually located in YNAB/Exports.
                        You will receive a notification on success or on failure.

                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        Getting transactions into YNAB from YNABcompanion is very easy.
                        As noted above, it's recommended that you import your YNAB budget and register into YNABcompanion, to ensure that YNAB reads YNABcompanion's transactions correctly.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Break}"/>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        To export your transactions, tap the "Export" button the menu.
                        If it's the first time you've imported or exported anything, you will be prompted to sign into Dropbox and allow YNABcompanion access.
                        Once that's done, YNABcompanion will create a csv file for each account full of its transactions in the YNABcompanion folder in Dropbox.
                        For example, if you have accounts A and B on YNABcompanion, A.csv and B.csv will be created.
                        Users can then import these transactions by importing each csv file into each account.
                        For example, for accounts A and B, a user would navigate to the account A page in YNAB and import A.csv, and do the same for account B in YNAB.
                    </TextBlock>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Break}"/>
                    <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource Body}">
                        Please note that exporting transactions from YNABcompanion into Dropbox will clear YNABcompanion of all transactions.
                        This is done to avoid exporting a transaction more than once (and thereby avoid importing a transaction into YNAB multiple times).
                        As a result, it's recommended that you delete the csv files from Dropbox after you have imported them into Dropbox.
